# PR Co-Pilot 🤖

**AI-Powered Pull Request Management for Open Source Maintainers**

Stop drowning in pull requests. Let AI handle the triage so you can focus on what matters: building great software.

---

## The Problem

You love open source, but PR management is exhausting:

- **Too many PRs, too little time** - Your backlog keeps growing while contributors wait
- **Hard to prioritize** - Which PRs need urgent attention? Which can wait?
- **Repetitive triage work** - Checking CI status, labeling, assigning reviewers... every single time
- **Contributor communication fatigue** - Writing the same "please add tests" comment for the 50th time
- **Risk of burnout** - Late nights reviewing PRs instead of coding or living your life

Sound familiar? **You're not alone.** 45% of open source organizations cite maintainer burnout as their #1 challenge in 2025.

---

## The Solution

**PR Co-Pilot is your intelligent PR management assistant.** It automatically triages incoming pull requests, prioritizes your workload, and helps you make faster decisions—so you can spend less time managing and more time building.

### What Makes Us Different

Unlike code review tools that just scan for bugs, PR Co-Pilot focuses on **workflow automation**:

✅ **Intelligent Triage** - Automatically classifies every PR (Ready to Merge, Needs Discussion, Blocked, etc.)  
✅ **Smart Prioritization** - Scores PRs 0-100 based on impact, urgency, and contributor trust  
✅ **Context-Aware Analysis** - Understands your project's history, patterns, and community norms  
✅ **Reviewer Routing** - Suggests the right maintainer based on expertise and availability  
✅ **Burnout Prevention** - Monitors your workload and suggests when to take a break  

**Think of it as having an experienced co-maintainer who never sleeps.**

2. @maintainer_b (backup, light current workload)

Pre-Merge Checklist:

- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry added
- [x] No breaking changes
```

### 3. Interact Via Simple Commands
Maintainers can trigger actions using bot commands:

```

**Volunteer Maintainers**
You maintain projects in your spare time and need to maximize efficiency.

**Growing Projects**
Your contributor base is expanding faster than your maintainer team.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate is the classification?

Our classification accuracy is 80%+ validated by maintainer feedback. When confidence is low (<70%), PR Co-Pilot will flag uncertainty and suggest manual review.

### Will this replace human maintainers?

**Absolutely not.** PR Co-Pilot is a **co-pilot**, not an autopilot. It handles the repetitive triage work so you can focus on the judgment calls that require human expertise—architectural decisions, community management, and mentoring contributors.

### What about code security?

We never store your code long-term. Analysis happens in-memory and results are ephemeral. For maximum security, use our self-hosted open source version.

### Does it work with private repositories?

Yes, on the Pro tier. The free tier is for public open source projects only.

### What if the bot makes a mistake?

Maintainers can always override any decision. Use `@PRCoPilot /reclassify` to provide feedback, which helps the system learn and improve.

### How much does it cost to run?

For the free tier, we cover the LLM API costs (approximately $0.10-0.50 per PR analysis). Pro users get unlimited usage as part of their subscription.

### Can I customize the classification categories?

Not yet, but it's on our roadmap for Phase 4. You can request custom categories for Enterprise plans.
